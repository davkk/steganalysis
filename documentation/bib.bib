    abstract = {Steganography is the art and science of hidden (or covered)
                communication. In digital steganography, the bits of image, video
                , audio and text files are tweaked to represent the information
                to hide. This article covers the current methods for hiding
                information in images, alongside steganalysis methods that aim to
                detect the presence of steganography. By reviewing 456 references
                , this article discusses the different approaches that can be
                taken toward steganography and its much less widely studied
                counterpart. Currently in research older steganography approaches
                are more widely used than newer methods even though these show
                greater potential. New methods do have flaws; therefore, more
                research is needed to make these practically applicable. For
                steganalysis one of the greatest challenges is the
                generalisability. Often one scheme can detect the presence of one
                specific hiding method. More research is needed to combine
                current schemes and/or create new generalisable schemes. To allow
                readers to compare results between different papers in our work,
                performance indications of all steganalysis methods are outlined
                and a comparison of performance is included. This comparison is
                given using ‘topological sorting’ graphs, which compares
                detection results from all papers (as stated in the papers
                themselves) on different steganographic schemes.},

    abstract = {LSB matching revisited is an LSB-based approach for image
                steganography. This method is a type of coding to increase the
                capacity of steganography. In this method, two bits of the secret
                message are hidden in two pixels with only one change. But this
                method provides no idea for hiding a message with a large number
                of bits. In other words, this method works only for n = 2, where
                n is the number of bits in a block of the secret message. In this
                paper, we propose an improved version of the LSB matching
                revisited approach, which works for n > 2. The proposed scheme
                contains two phases including embedding and extracting the
                message. In the embedding phase, we first convert the secret
                message into a bit-stream, and then the bit-stream is divided
                into a set of blocks including n bits in each block. Then we
                choose 2n−1 pixels for hiding such n bits of the secret message.
                In the next step, we choose the operations needed to generate
                such a message. Finally, we perform the obtained operations over
                the coefficients to hide the secret message. The proposed
                approach needs fewer changes than LSB MR when n > 2. The capacity
                of the proposed approach is (((2n − 1)/2n−1) − 1) × 100\% higher
                than the F5 method where this value for n > 2 is bigger than 75\%
                . For example, the capacity of our scheme is 75\% higher than the
                capacity of F5 for n = 3. The proposed method can be used in the
                first step of every steganography method to reduce the change in
                the stego image. Therefore, this method is a new coding method
                for steganography. Our experimental results using steganalysis
                show that using our method provides around 10\% higher detection
                error for SRNet over two steganography schemes.},

    abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that
                each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled
                independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the
                forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a
                limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The
                generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on
                the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the
                correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to
                split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to
                Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings
                of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but
                are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor
                error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the
                response to increasing the number of features used in the
                splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable
                importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

    abstract = {This paper presents an active steganalysis technique for echo
                hiding (EH). This approach can differentiate stego audios (with
                hidden message) from nature ones (without hidden message), and
                then extract sequential EH messages in stego audios without prior
                knowledge about the EH technique. The procedure of this algorithm
                can be simplified as follows: (i) Sliding Windowed Cepstrum (SWC)
                is obtained by employing a Sliding Window (SW) to move over the
                audio signal sample by sample. (ii) The echo detector is designed
                based on statistical analysis of the Cepstrum Peak Location
                Aggregation Degree (CPLAD). (iii) For stego signals, both echo
                delay and the range of segment length are estimated by exploring
                the changing rule of the SWC. (iv) The accurate estimation of
                segment length and synchronism position is acquired by the grid
                search algorithm. (v) Finally, the binary secret message can be
                extracted using the estimated parameters in the previous steps.
                The proposed method has been implemented and tested to extract
                the message which is embedded into audio clips by using EH
                techniques with different kernels. The experimental results show
                that the accuracy of extraction is no less than 90\% when
                attenuation is greater than 0.45.},
